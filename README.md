For this project, I decided I wanted to create a small guitar store database, since I have recently been getting into guitar myself. Its a very simple database that includes guitars, sales, customers, staff, and guitar repairs. The AI did well on the prompts that I gave, and it didn't mess up on any of the prompts as far as I could tell. I used zero shot training, which was able to give me concise and simple responses and queries. I do however think other training would have been more useful with more data being put into the database.
